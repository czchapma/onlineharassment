# Stop Harassment

Stop Harassment is a project by Uplift: Online Communities Against Sexual Violence attempting to solve the problem of harassment
that many people experience once they reach a certain point of popularity online.  This disproportionately affects more women, people of color, and LGBTQIA+ individuals and these harassers work to silence these populations.

Though online platforms offer the ability to block specific harassing users, blocking one user only results in 5 more coming on to join
their place.

The problem is the harassing content, not the users, so the solution needs to lie in the content itself.

## Current Status
* Basic UI for the Chrome Extension that allows users to put words in their blacklist and choose whether they're filtering out or not
* Integration with Watson's API to analyze the sentiment of words and remove posts containing harassing uses of the word
* Works for Twitter and YouTube

## Future Directions
* Integration with HackHarassment's harassment classifier
* Extensive settings for users (see UX in presentation) allowing the user to add additional words, whitelist users, and show hidden tweets
* Firefox and Safari extensions
* Hide harassing images
* Solution for Mobile
* Support for Facebook, Tumblr, etc.

## Project History
This project began at the Lesbians Who Tech Social Good Hackathon on 9/24/16.
